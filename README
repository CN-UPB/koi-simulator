The KoI Simulator
=================

This package contains the source code and simulation parameters for the KOI 
scheduling simulations.

For installation/build instructions, please consult the INSTALL file.

To execute an example simulation, build the simulation code as described in 
the INSTALL file. Then, have a look into the 
simulations folder for 
configurations.

Generating the Documentation
----------------------------

To generate the documentation, you need the software Doxygen, to generate 
the C++ API docs. Additionally, you will need a working version of the 
Omnet++ Eclipse IDE. First, change to the directory where you downloaded 
the simulation software and run
	
	$ doxygen Doxyfile

This command will place the C++ API docs in the directory `doc/doxy`.
To generate the documentation for the NED files, open the Omnet++ IDE 
with a valid workspace. Then, import the KOI Simulator project by 
choosing *Import...* from the *File* menu, then 
*Existing projects into Workspace* as the import source. 

Then, on the *Import Projects* mask, click *Browse* and navigate to the 
directory where you stored the simulator. Afterwards, a project named 
*abstractLte* should show up under *Projects*. Select it and click *finish*.

After you've imported the project successfully, right click it in your project 
explorer and choose *Generate NED Documentation*. Now, you will find 
the full documentation under the `doc/neddoc` directory. To read the 
freshly generated documentation, point your browser to `doc/index.html`.


History
--------

This simulation was developed in the KoI project http://www.koi-projekt.de. 
It is partially based on older simulation software, coming out of RWTH Aachen, TU Berlin, 
KTH Stockholm, and Paderborn University. A grateful hattip to all the work that preceeded this one!
