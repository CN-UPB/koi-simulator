Installation of the KOI Simulator
=================================

This is a short description of the steps necessary to install the KOI 
Simulator.

Prerequisites
-------------

The KOI Simulator is based on the OMNET++ framework. 

To install OMNET++, a C++ compiler (like GCC or CLANG) is necessary.

Follow the steps described in the 
[Omnet installation manual](https://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/InstallGuide.pdf)
to install OMNET++ from [here](https://omnetpp.org/omnetpp).

The KOI simulation also requires the IT++ library. Install it via your 
distribution's package manager. The library is probably named "itpp" or 
"libitpp".

In addition, the BOOST random library is needed.

Compilation
-----------

Before compiling the Simulator, make sure that the OMNET++ binaries are in your 
PATH. Change into your OMNET++ directory and enter ". setenv".

After having added the binaries to your PATH, change back into the KOI 
Simulator root directory and execute "make". This will generate the necessary 
make files and compile the Simulator proper.

You will find the executable in the out/ directory, as well as a softlink in 
the src/ directory.
