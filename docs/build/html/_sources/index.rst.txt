History 
=======

This simulation was developed in the KoI project http://www.koi-projekt.de. 
It is partially based on older simulation software, coming out of RWTH Aachen, TU Berlin, 
KTH Stockholm, and Paderborn University. A grateful hattip to all the work that preceeded this one! 

This simulator was used in and developed in the context of the followin papers (among others): 

- M. Bohge, J. Gross, and A. Wolisz

“Optimal Soft Frequency Reuse and Dynamic Sub-carrier Assignments in Cellular OFDMA Networks” 
Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies, vol. 21, no. 8, pp. 704–713, 2010.

- D. Parruca and J. Gross

“Throughput Analysis of Proportional Fair Scheduling For Sparse and Ultra-Dense Interference-Limited OFDMA/LTE Networks”
IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, vol. 15, no. 10, pp. 6857-6870, 2016.
