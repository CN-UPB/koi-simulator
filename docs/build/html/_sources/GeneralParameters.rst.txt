General Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Firstly, the antennas position for each BaseStation are calculated taking in the consideration the height of the base station, the position and the number of antennas. Each of these parameters can be edit by the user.

- The directions of the azimuth and zenith angles of arrival and departures are calculated cycling through all the receiver MobileStation. The angles obtained in the cartesian coordinates are transformed to the spherical coordinates.

-  For each pair of sender/receiver, the METIS computations check if there is a line of sight between them. For this purpose, the probabilities are computed using the formula on section 7.3.10 in [NKRR14]_.

- The correlated large-scale parameters (delay spread, angular spread, Ricean K factor, and shadow fading) are computed taking into consideration the cross-correlation according to the Table 7-13 in [NKRR14]_. The corresponding parameters are calculated for the line of sight and non-line of sight scenarios. For the computation of the large-scale parameters, the auto-correlation is first generated by taking into consideration the decorrelation coefficients.
