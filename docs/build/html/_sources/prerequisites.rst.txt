Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The KoI Simulator is based on the OMNET++ framework.

To install OMNET++, a C++ compiler (like GCC or CLANG) is necessary.

Follow the steps described in the
[Omnet installation manual](https://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/InstallGuide.pdf)
to install OMNET++ from [here](https://omnetpp.org/omnetpp).

The KOI simulation also requires the IT++ library. Install it via your
distribution's package manager. The library is probably named "itpp" or
"libitpp".

In addition, the BOOST random library is needed.
