Compilation
^^^^^^^^^^^

Before compiling the Simulator, make sure that the OMNET++ binaries are in your
PATH. Change into your OMNET++ directory and enter ". setenv".

After having added the binaries to your PATH, change back into the KOI
Simulator root directory and execute "make". This will generate the necessary
make files and compile the Simulator proper.

You will find the executable in the out/ directory, as well as a softlink in
the src/ directory.
